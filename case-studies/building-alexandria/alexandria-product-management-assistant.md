  * https://bravura-security.aha.io/products/AL
  * https://bravura-security.aha.io/ideas/ideas/AL-I-35

# Alexandria Background

Alexandria is an AI platform designed to optimize businesses operations.
At its heart, Alexandria is a platform that aids people in navigating the diverse knowledge that underpins our businesses. Its a library of knowledge held in a diverse set of books. Its name being inspired by the Library of Alexandria. 

It assists people to come to decisions faster and generate higher quality content. But at all times people remain in control and are ultimately responsible for their decisions they make. This is why Alexandria stresses its usage of assistants. Alexandria and its assistants are there to help and empower you. But you are at all times in control and responsible for what is being done. 

And in any library, you can have alot of books. Books can come in many forms. For example: 

* Our customer documentation
* Project plans
* Our Source code
* Open Source code
* Our product documentation
* Third party product documentation
 
Even moderately sized businesses can have hundreds of books when you think about just how many things we deal with in the course of doing work. 

Assistants are used to navigate this huge diversity of books in our library. For example:

* Navigating our source code - ie git
* Navigating our documentation
* Navigating our support tickets
* Navigating books in sharepoint ( coming soon )

But also more than this, Alexandria can help us identify problems in our knowledge. When it has access to our books it can help flag problems. Highlight great content. And allow us to plan improvements at scale. 

Alexandria is also intended to empower all areas of a business. We will be building out material about how Alexandria can help optimize these diverse sets of operations:  

* Alexandria for Sales
* Alexandria for Marketing
* Alexandria for Customer Support
* Alexandria for Product Management
* Alexandria for Engineering
* Alexandria for Quality Assurance
* Alexandria for Professional Services
* Alexandria for Legal

## Comparison with other AI Tools
There are many AI tools out there. And Alexandria doesn't intended to replace any of them. What it intends to do is augment your other choices and bridge the knowledge that exists in the various silos that otherwise exist. For example:

Zendesk: If you use the Zendesk AI bot, you should continue to use it. It excels with content stored in Zendesk. But you also probably want Alexandria to allow for richer and more complex insights when your questions need to also consult source code, legacy knowledge bases, sharepoint documentation, etc. 

Microsoft Copilot: Copilot can be great when you want to work with content specific in the microsoft ecosystem. But often our work spans additional spaces such as Aha, Jira, Bitbucket, Github, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc. Alexandria with its flexible assistant architecture allow you to ask questions about any content in any form across your organization. 

Coding Assistants: There are many coding assistants out there at various levels of maturity. And when they work they can work really well - for your code. But they often struggle with large legacy code bases. Code bases that have mixtures of history. And the need to reflect the reality of software engineering such as comparing code to designs, such as extracting test cases from code, and extracting documentation from what was implemented. Alexandria treats all of your knowledge, documentation, designs, test cases, etc as content that can be consumed and factored into the creation of new content. And it can do it at exceptional scale such as with code repositories with millions of lines of code built up over 30 years. Some alternatives that we continue to review and track include:

* Devin AI Website - The First AI Software Engineer Cognition
* OpenDevin/OpenDevin: üêö OpenDevin: Code Less, Make More (github.com)
* paul-gauthier/aider: aider is AI pair programming in your terminal (github.com)
* GitHub Copilot ¬∑ Your AI pair programmer

# Go To Market Strategy

* Target Higher Education vertical for new logo wins
* Sell new capabilities back to our base which is about 70% Bravura Pass, 15% Bravura Privilege, and 15% Bravura Identity. Bravura Safe and Bravura Cloud are recent additions to the portfolio. 


# Aha Configuration

## Ideas

Ideas capture user feedback in a format that allows product management to provide guidance about existing ways to tackle a problem or to evaluate potentially adding new capabilities to the product. 

A good Idea should have

* A useful title
* A summary of what is the challenge being faced?
* A summary of what the impact of challenge is?
* A detailed description of the idea

### Example 1:

**Title:**

Integrate ideas with Jira

**What is the challenge?**

Companies that use both Jira and Aha! ideas must go through extra steps to send information between the two systems.

For example, if a small fix comes in as an Aha! idea, it must first be promoted to a feature or requirement before if is sent to Jira to be worked on. Often PMs teams would prefer to not track these as features in Aha! roadmaps.

**What is the impact?**

Saves time for both Aha! user and Jira users. Helps teams work together across systems and stay up-to-date on work.

**Describe your idea**

The Jira integration should support mapping to ideas records like it does features.

### Example 2:

**Title:**

Rally Project name change should be reflecting in the Aha! Integration

**What is the challenge?**

Rally Project name is updated but the project name is not updating in the Aha Integration Project Tab?

**What is the impact?**

Users see the wrong project name in the Aha integration and think they need to create a new integration.

**Describe your idea**

We would like to have the Project name automatically update in Aha when the Rally Project name changes.

## Features

Features are wrote in a user story style. Features should represent exceptionally high quality user stories and best practices. 

A good feature should have:

* Title that is a user story
* A description that further expounds on the user story and provides background research
* A description that also includes acceptance criteria. 

### Example 1:

User Story: 

As a credit card holder, I want to view my statement (or account) balance, so that I can pay the balance due.

Background:

<any useful background of value>

Acceptance Criteria:

* Display statement balance upon authentication. Say for example $1560
* Display total balance. For example $3560. Here the balance due from the current period is $2560 and past balance due is $2000.
* Show Minimum payment due. For example $140
* Show Payment due date. For example May 16th of the current month
* Show error message if service not responding or timeout. For example ‚ÄòSorry, something went wrong with the service. Please try again.‚Äô

### Example 2:

User Story: 

As a teacher, I want to generate assessment report, so I can evaluate student performance.

Background:

<any useful background of value>

Acceptance Criteria: 

* Show a student‚Äôs current assessment score.
* Display past assessment score of the student.
* Provide an option to Print / Save / Share. (By the way, this could be split as a separate user story by itself).
* Display error message if service not responding. (If a team chooses to add the Error Message as their definition of done for all stories ‚Äì where ever applicable, it could be omitted from the acceptance criteria).


## Epics

Epics are used to hold collections of user stories to complete a project phase of work. A project phase may be delivered over multiple sprints.

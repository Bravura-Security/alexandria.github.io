# Building Alexandria

In this case study we review the steps that are taken to build alexandira. It goes over

1. How aha is used with a product management assistant
1. How jira is used to action and track progress
1. How a development assistant is used to action jira tickets

In this you will see the full end to end sequence of steps that allows for rapid development of a platform such as alexandria. 

# Collecting Ideas

We use [Aha!](https://www.aha.io/) to collect ideas, define our roadmaps, and plan our our epics and features. 

To aid with this process we have created a [product management assistant](alexandria-product-management-assistant) that helps with many routine tasks such as:

* Critiqueing and enriching strategy documentation
* Enriching ideas
* Enriching epics
* Enriching features

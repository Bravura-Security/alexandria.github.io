# Books

Books are units of knowledge that exist in Alexandria. They help us organize content. And bring in content at the right time to assistants to answer questions. Books can take many forms. Just like in real live you have

* Paperback books
* Magazines
* Online books

Alexandria is the same. Books can be composed of:

* Pdfs
* Word documents
* Source code locations
* etc.

A book represents a logical chunk of information. And books can have multiple versions. For example, books about our products could be assembled where you have a different book for each different version of the product documentation you want to use. 

This will then allow your [assistants](/alexandria.github.io/assistants/intro) to be able to bring in the right information at the right time  given the users questions they raise.

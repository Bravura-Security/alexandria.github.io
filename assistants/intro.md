# Assistants

Assistants are the subject matter experts that allow people to navigate the library of knowledge. They are composed of the following main parts

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Title | Descriptive title for the assitant explaining what its great at |
| AI Model | Advanced or Normal. Advanced is slower but good at complex tasks like coding. Normal is quicker and more suitable for question and answering scenarios | 
| Description | A summary of what the assistant can do. The kinds of questions it should try to answer. And most importantly, the questions it shouldn't try to answer. This helps Aleandria choose the best assistant to help with different questions |

| Books | Optional books that the assistant can reference. Useful for bringing in background material and sharing background material between assistants |
| Content | The heart of the assistant. Its persona. Its guidelines it should follow. What it must not do. Background knowledge useful about who we are as a business. Templates of good work we expect the assistant to produce |

# Knowledge Management

Alexandria is built on the concept of leveraging the knowledge that exists in a business. Knowledge takes many forms. For example:

| Area | Knowledge Held |
|------|----------------|
| Customer support tickets | Troubleshooting steps. Feature adoption. Customer sentiment | 
| Source code | Samples to create new code. Product requirements. Troubleshooting information. |
| Project plans | Feature adoption. Key use cases. |
| Hubspot | Customer engagement. Market interest. |
| RFPs | Market demands. Market trends | 

This information is historically siloed along department lines. Reducing our ability to leverage this knowledge to generate competitive edges. 

We try to leverage it when we can. For example, our customer support staff will reach out to engineering to brainstorm ways to troubleshoot problems. But if we have tools like Alexandria that can help with this, we can help people get answers quickly. Reduce waiting times for people who may be out, on vacation, or sick. And reduce distractions for simple to answer problems. 

This is the fundamental tenant of aleandria. We are leveraging it to break down knowledge silos and to assist with team members to be able to be as efficient as possible. 

# Comparison to a library. 

Alexandria's name is inspired by the Library of Alexandria. The largest and most important library of antiquity that held the worlds known knowledge. That knowledge was in many forms. And many people frequented it. They leveraged the expertise of assistants to navigate the library and find knowledge across various domains to drive new insights and ideas.

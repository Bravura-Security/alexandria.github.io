# Day 1 Configuration

## Planning
In preparation for Day 1, you will need to do the following tasks. 

* Generate a list of between 2 and 5 people who will be in your original group of pilot users. 

* At a minimum you should have two people so people can brainstorm with each other. 

Best not to have more than 5 since you need to be able to keep scope and focus for your first few weeks. 
 

## Determine how you want to authenticate

Right now authentication is done through username, password, and authenticator app pin. It is mandatory that 2fa is always used for data security reasons.

The near term roadmap will introduce the ability to

* Delegated user administration
* Federated authentication via OIDC and SAML
* Webauthn authentication

# About Alexandria

Alexandria is an AI platform for business optimization. It is intended to enable all areas of a business. 

A key challenge with adopting AI platforms is measuring your return on investment. This return can be measured in many forms such as

* Measure areas of your operations that you never could measure before.
* Higher quality content being generated
* Content being generated faster
* Improved employee satisfaction by giving them alternatives to tedious tasks they dislike doing. 
* Help people fill in skill gaps rapidly and grow their skills

# Tips and tricks for using alexandria

## Ask specific questions

When people ask questions like "can you write me a script that can show user adoption?" they may think their question is good. If they ask this of a fellow employee, that fellow employee might be able to answer it and point them in the right direction. But Alexandria doesn't necessarily share the same knowledge of those employees. As such, it may have to guess what scripting language you want to use, what apis might be available, and what products you are talking about. The end result is likely a bad answer.

This is the same result as if you asked that question of an employee in a different area of the company. Maybe they work on a different product. So if they tried to answer your question, they may answer it given their knowledge. Also resulting in an incorrect answer from the perspective of the person asking the question. 

If you instead asked a question such as "can you write me a python script that uses the rest api of bravura pass to show daily active users over the last month?" all of a sudden Alexanrdia has much more information to go off of. It can likely choose the right assistant ( if you have multiple products and apis ), and it can generate a script in the right language ( python vs java for example ). This question has a much better chance of being answered correctly by both alexandria and any employees of your company. Everyone benefits by asking more specific questions. 

## Tune assistants to internal knowledge.

When people ask questions of people they work with for long periods of time, they tend to ask a question like "can you take a look at iddb and see why its so slow?" which depends on a great deal of knowledge learned over time. Without calibration of assistants, alexandria knows nothing about iddb. Is it a server? Is it part of our software? Is it something provided by a third party? 

In order to get alexandria to be able to answer such a question you need too create an assistant that understands what iddb is. Has references to books and urls that can be used to answer the question. 

## Explain the steps you want the AI to take

Many questions people ask need multiple steps to be taken to answer the question. For example: 

```
I have a customer ticket XYZ. Can you search for other tickets that have had this problem and let me know how they solved the problem?
```

To answer this question, you need to do the following steps

1) Retrieve the content of ticket XYZ
2) Extract out potential searches that could be ran to find tickets with similar problems reported
3) Run those searches to find results that might be applicable. Searches might be
     * Searching other customer tickets for related issues
     * Searching the internet since maybe the problem is known in reddit or third party documentation
4) Retrieve the content of the tickets that have the best info
5) Generate a reponse based on the retrieved content. 

Alexandria needs to understand it would need to follow the same steps in order to get useful information. While it can often figure out to do this, its often best to be explicit in either:

* The question you ask - ie explain the steps as if you were getting a new hire to your team to do the search
* Or better - give these steps to the assistant in its "Content" so it knows how to tackle these problems and what sources it can use to answer questions. 

# How Alexandria Processes questions

Alexandria uses Anthropic Claude sonnet 3.5 to answer questions. The general sequence of steps that are taken to generate a response is:

1) User asks a question 
2) Alexandria receives the question
3) Alexandria reviews the question and determines which assistant should be used to answer the question. Alexandria uses the assistant title and description to determine which assistant to use. This is why its critical that the description hold information about what questions the assistant is good at answering, and which questions it should not try to answer. 
4) Alexandria loads the assistant that it determines is best. 
5) Alexandria then gives the users question to claude 3.5 sonnet along with a list of tools that can be used to help in answering the question. Tools that are available include:

* Bing search to search the internet
* Jira to interact with jira tickets and content
* Aha to interact with ideas, features, research, etc
* Zendesk to interact with customer tickets
* And in the future, more tools will be getting added. 

6) Alexandria then asks the AI to generate a response. The AI may choose to generate output, or ask for a tool to be ran. 
7) If a tool is asked to be ran, the tool is ran, the output is then added to the chat history, then step 6 is repeated.
8) When no tools need to be ran then the AI will emit the final information that is then given to the user.

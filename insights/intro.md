# Insights

Insights are extracted from the knowledge held in our organization. Insights are extracted by applying a score card to content. So to have an insight you must have 

* Clearly identified content.
* A score card ( or rubric ) that content can be assessed against.

For example, a score card for a blog post could be

| Insight | Description | Scale |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Clarity | How clear is the blog post. Does it read well? | 1 (poor) - 5 (exceptional) |
| Accuracy | Are there factually incorrect items? | 1 ( yes, many) - 5 (none observed ) |
| Engagement | How well the content keeps the reader interested and encourages interaction. | 1 (low engagement) - 5 (highly engaging) |
|Relevance | How well the content addresses the needs and interests of the intended audience. |1 (off-target) - 5 (highly relevant) |
